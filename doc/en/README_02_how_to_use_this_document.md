# Vim Usage Instructions

Learning vim is very different from learning `mathematics` and `algorithms`.
It is similar to learning `brushes` and `skating` which require a lot of
practice. Learn `Vim`, you can’t learn just by reading the document,
and it’s useless by rote memorization. Even if your memory is amazing,
it won’t work. Because `Vim` is used through muscle memory,
not through brain thinking, because Muscle memory responds much faster.

Tell you a little story of my own. I went to an interview, and I was asked
"How to jump to the beginning of the line in vim?", Simple question,
but I thought about it for 2 seconds and answered about it,
but at that time I had been using `Vim` for about 7 years.
Why don't you need these 2 seconds of thinking when you use it?
Because when you use `Vim`, you use muscle memory to use `Vim`,
without brain thinking.

The process of learning `Vim` is constant practice, constant use, and naturally
you can use it. So in the process of reading this document, it is recommended
to clone the repository to your computer first. Use `Vim` to read directly,
and operate directly during the reading process.

```
git clone https://github.com/MDGSF/MyVim.git ~/.MyVim
```

Please read [Install](README_03_install.md) firstly, install `Vim` with basic
settings.

If you have never been in contact with `Vim`, it is recommended to read
[vimtutor 30-minute introduction to vim](README_vim_tutor.md),
Of course, even if you have used `vim` for many years, reading `vimtutor`
is likely to learn new things.


You can also directly enter the text
[Vim open and close](README_vim_1.1_open_close.md)。

If you are reading the document with `vim`, you can move the cursor to any
position on `README_vim_1.1_open_close.md`, and then execute `gf` to jump to
the corresponding document.


In other words, as long as you move the cursor to the file name and
execute `gf`, it will jump to the corresponding document. `gf` is the meaning
of `goto file`, if you are interested in learning more,
you can execute `:help gf`.

Use `ctrl+^` to jump back. `ctrl+^` can jump between
`last used document` and `current document`.

Move the cursor to the file name below and use `gf` to jump.

A man has found gold.
Everyone is rushing to the same spot.
Even the cactii are joining the frey.
A steam train is off the rails.
Most people are carrying a shovel or a pick axe.
Waldo is studying his clipboard.
A clown is riding a unicycle.
A victorian gentleman is riding a penny farthing.
The penny farthing is 10 paces ahead of Waldo.
